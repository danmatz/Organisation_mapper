# Organisation_mapper
 
The client set to create an organisational development project for a medium size Hungarian firm. Their goal was to figure out who should be picked to become a manager within the employees. In order to get information of the workers they wanted to see the path of information within the firm. They asked us to deliver the techical side of a quiestionaire which filters answers based on one's department and stores their answer. 

The custom developed application built in *Meteor.js and MongoDB*, deployed to *Heroku*. We have used Gephi to visualize the graphs, color coding departments, size represented number of in-edges. 

This repo contains the collected answers (anonymized) and the generated graphs - if you have further questions please contact me directly.
